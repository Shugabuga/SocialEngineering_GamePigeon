    <center><p>What you just clicked on wasn't a game of pool, but a link.
       iOS 10 converts links into nice pretty bubbles, but this can be used maliciously.</p></center>
    <center><p>Next time I would confirm if there was a link attached to the bottom of this
      message bubble. If there's no subtitle with a URL, you are likely safe, but only
      play with friends and family, and not strangers. You never know who may be trying to
      hack or decieve you!</p></center>
